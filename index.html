  <h1>Global Warming</h1>
      <h2>What Is Global Warming?</h2>
 
      <p>The drastic increase of carbon dioxide, caused by burning fosil fuels, is the main reason global warming has became an issue. The greenhouse gases trap the heat from the Sun onto Earth. So the more carbon dioxide the bigger increase of heat.  </p>
      
      <h2> How Do People Cause It? </h2>
      <p> We are the cause of global warming. As much as we would like to deny it, we are destroying the Earth. You can say you are saving the Earth by recycling but you are still burning fossil fuels. When we drive cars, burn coal, etc. gasses are emmited into the air, and these gases trap heat onto Earth's surface.</p>
      
      <h2>How Are Animals Affected? </h2>
      <p> Some animal, like in the North and South poles, need cold enviroments. So if the Earth is hot EVERYWHERE that some animals may die from the heat. Their ecosystems will be destroyed, ice and snow melting. </p>
      
      <h2>How Is Our Earth Affected?</h2>
      <p>Sea levels rise <br>
Decrease in snow and ice <br>
Melting of polar ice caps <br>
Floods and droughts become more common <br>
Less freshwater will be available <br>
  </p>
