      <h2>What Is Global Warming?</h2>
 
      <p>The <em>drastic</em> increase of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gases, caused by burning fosil fuels, is the main reason global warming has became an issue. <br>
        The greenhouse gases trap the heat from the Sun onto Earth. So the more fossil fuels we burn the bigger increase of heat.  </p>
      
      <h2> How Do People Cause It? </h2>
      <p> When people burn coal, oil and gas to drive our cars or generate electricity, carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, where it traps heat. <br>We are the cause of global warming. As much as we would like to deny it, we are destroying the Earth. You can say you are saving the Earth by <br>
        recycling but you are still burning fossil fuels. When we drive cars, burn coal, etc. gasses are emmited into the air, and these gases trap heat onto <br>
        Earth's surface.</p>
      
      <h2>How Are Animals Affected? </h2>
      <p> Some animals, like in the North and South poles, need cold enviroments. So if it is hot everywhere then some animals may die from the heat.<br>
        Their ecosystems will be destroyed, ice and snow melting. </p>
      
      <h2>How Is Our Earth Affected?</h2>
      <p>Sea levels rise. <br>
Decrease in snow and ice. <br>
Melting of polar ice caps. <br>
Floods and droughts become more common. <br>
Less freshwater will be available. <br>
  </p>
      
      <h2>How Can We Prevent It? </h2>
      <p> If only electric cars are invented than we would be burning less fossil fuels. If we are careful and are aware </p>
