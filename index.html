  <h1>Global Warming</h1>
      <h2>What Is Global Warming?</h2>
 
      <p>The drastic increase of carbon dioxide, caused by burning fosil fuels, is the main reason global warming has became an issue. The greenhouse gases trap the heat from the Sun onto Earth. So the more carbon dioxide the bigger increase of heat.  </p>
      
      <h2> How Do People Cause It? </h2>
      <p> We are the cause of global warming. As much as we would like to deny it, we are destroying the Earth. You can say you are saving the Earth by recycling but you are still burning fossil fuels. When we drive cars, burn coal, etc. gasses are emmited into the air, and these gases trap heat onto Earth's surface.</p>
